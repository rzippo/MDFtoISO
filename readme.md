A port of the [mdf2iso](http://www.mdftoiso.com) tool from Salvatore Santagati for the UWP platform.
Meant to make the tool available on the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PCZBVLLDSX4).

Icons made editing together works by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/) from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/).

Because of publishing-specific configurations which need to be removed, this repository is updated later then the one used for developement and publication.
Consider contacting me to be sure to access the latest code.
